# Computability and Complexity Theory, Algorithms and Data Structures

A repository of solutions to problems in Computability and Complexity Theory, Algorithms, and Data Structures.

## Topics Covered

### Computability and Complexity

Topics: Turing machines, Church’s thesis, computable and noncomputable functions, recursive (decidable) and recursively enumerable (recognizable) sets, reductions. Complexity classes P, NP, polynomial time reducibility, NP-completeness, self-reducibility, space complexity classes L, NL, PSPACE.

### Algorithms

Topics: Various algorithmic paradigms including divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, linear programming, network flows.

### Data Structures

Topics: ADTs including graphs, dictionaries, priority queues, and disjoint sets. Data structures including BSTs, AVL trees, hashing, heaps, etc. Also includes some average-case and amortized complexity analysis and algorithms including Kruskal, Prim, DFS, BFS, etc.
